## Project Details
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques to predict stock prices accurately and identify patterns in stock market data.

### Methods
We employ deep learning architectures, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze historical stock data and make future price predictions.

### Data
The project utilizes historical stock market data, including price, volume, and other relevant financial indicators, obtained from reputable financial data sources.

### Results
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep learning approach in predicting stock prices and detecting patterns in financial data.
